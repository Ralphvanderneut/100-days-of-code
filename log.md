# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Some new insights on the teleport feature of vue3. created a small component to test its functionality fast. Some small optimizations of visual studio code.

**Thoughts:** The feature is really easy and user friendly. However not completely sure in what kind of situation i would need this. Also i don't really know the smart features of visual code. This seems to cost me a lot extra clicks. Which instead i could do with just some keyboard shortcuts. Have to look more to optimizing my code editor experience :)

### Day 2: September 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Build a vue component which draws a canvas version of the dom in utrecht netherlands

**Thoughts:** Canvas is really cool to make visual design in html. I want do more with this so in the future i will look at some libraries.

### Day 3: September 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: start building a anime suggestion component. Using new ecma features arrow function,block scopes,async,rest and spread, classes, import/export i got from a blog. Its hard getting used to arrow functions and destructering objects.

**Thoughts:** There are so many usefull new ecma functions i haven't explored yet. These will definitely help me improve some work code.

### Day 4: October 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: finished the technical part of the anime suggestion. used export function for treeshaking. Also more in depth use of await and async.

**Thoughts:** Its sometime little hard to understand how different js functions work. Also can't acces the this from the vue component. possibly i had to use bind!

### Day 5: October 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started using tailwindcss to style my anime suggestion component.

**Thoughts:** Its weird that you only use utility functions. At first its a little hard cause your not familiar with the syntax. Then is just installed the plugin for vs code. That helped a lot. It also mainly uses rem which i never used. Further i really like using it. Feels new.

### Day 6: October 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Going a little further in tailwindcss. Also rewrote the anime suggestion logic in composition api.

**Thoughts:** Composition api makes structuring the page code easier. You can better organize the functions in composable js functions. it has a little of a learning curve. Isn't as easy to learn as the options api.

### Day 7: October 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Rewrote my anime suggestion component using typescript in vue3.

**Thoughts:** Typescript is a lott different than normal js. Its a little complicated with the mass different ways of written functions. How set types etc.

### Day 8: October 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: started my portfolio website project.

**Thoughts:** Trying to get my design into tailwindcss is harder than i thought. Also trying to create an old explorer structure for design. Also started using atom design to structure my website.

### Day 9: October 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: finished the header component with styling. Started with the sidebar and teh menu. Used flexbox to order the components.

**Thoughts:** The flexbox works a little different in combination with tailwindcss. I am started to better grasp the utilities i can use.

### Day 10: October 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Build a small composable function to emit a selected event. I use it over multiple components

**Thoughts:** Not really sure if this is the best solution. I still have troubles with the event structure of vuejs. But i need to understand more to build better apps.

### Day 11: October 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Almost none, wanted to build a modal and use transition. But got stuck only creating the modals and not fully grasping the inner workings.

**Thoughts:** It was a shitty day

### Day 12: October 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: built a transition component for a folder open animation.

**Thoughts:** It takes some tweaking to get a good transition. The classes are easy to understand.

### Day 14: October 11, 2020

### Day 15: October 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: started to create a modal which hangs in the site

**Thoughts:** started to change the config of tailwindcss. Its a little weird how to do it.
But the online site gives me a lot of help

### Day 16: October 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: modal blueprint finished and started the image gallery

**Thoughts:** Bad day!

### Day 17: October 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: build a small image gallery

**Thoughts:** Had some problem with tailwindcss flexbox! need to understand why it won't take my full width. Probably to little knowledge.

### Day 18: October 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I build a query search for airphotos of the dutch government search as a composable in vuejs.

**Thoughts:** The typescript types of ref and reactive are not easy to find on the vuejs site. Also the dutch government has an api where a all the images are deleted. So that was a little weird. Only the lint on run is to strict on spaces.

### Day 19: October 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started building a dutch to sith language component. Using google translate to translate dutch to english. Then using english to ranslate to sith using funtranslations. ALso using the suspense rfc from vue3 to show a loading message.

**Thoughts:** It took a lot of time to figure out to test the google translate api. Which isn't very user friendly.

### Day 20: October 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made it possible to translate dutch to sith language in the component.

**Thoughts:** During coding i thought about how cool it would be to do spoken language and get it returned to you through the speaker.

### Day 21: October 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started incorperating the web speech api to say text to translate.

**Thoughts:** The weird thing is that the code doesn't seem to read the transcript? But console.log can log the correct text. Need to further investigate.

### Day 22: October 20, 2020

### Day 23: October 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Web speech api translation componont technical part finished

**Thoughts:** had a good idea to let the text be spoken through the speakers. But typescript keeps throwing errors and has a hard time doing it.

**Link to work:** [portfolio site](https://github.com/Ralphvanderneut/100dayscodeprojects/tree/master/ralph-portfolio)

### Day 24: October 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Start rewriting the dutch to sith component in js

**Thoughts:** Seems like js file has a lot less trouble than the typescript. Probably still not fluent enough in typescript to comprehense it fully. Certainly in hard parts

**Link to work:** [portfolio site](https://github.com/Ralphvanderneut/100dayscodeprojects/tree/master/ralph-portfolio)

### Day 25: October 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: finished the logical part of the sith translator. started creating the layout.

**Thoughts:** Still trying to get the hang of tailwindcss. Sometimes forget that not all utility classes without a parent.
