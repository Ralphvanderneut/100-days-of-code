# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Some new insights on the teleport feature of vue3. created a small component to test its functionality fast. Some small optimizations of visual studio code.

**Thoughts:** The feature is really easy and user friendly. However not completely sure in what kind of situation i would need this. Also i don't really know the smart features of visual code. This seems to cost me a lot extra clicks. Which instead i could do with just some keyboard shortcuts. Have to look more to optimizing my code editor experience :)

### Day 2: September 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Build a vue component which draws a canvas version of the dom in utrecht netherlands

**Thoughts:** Canvas is really cool to make visual design in html. I want do more with this so in the future i will look at some libraries.

### Day 3: September 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: start building a anime suggestion component. Using new ecma features arrow function,block scopes,async,rest and spread, classes, import/export i got from a blog. Its hard getting used to arrow functions and destructering objects.

**Thoughts:** There are so many usefull new ecma functions i haven't explored yet. These will definitely help me improve some work code.

### Day 4: October 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: finished the technical part of the anime suggestion. used export function for treeshaking. Also more in depth use of await and async.

**Thoughts:** Its sometime little hard to understand how different js functions work. Also can't acces the this from the vue component. possibly i had to use bind!

### Day 5: October 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started using tailwindcss to style my anime suggestion component.

**Thoughts:** Its weird that you only use utility functions. At first its a little hard cause your not familiar with the syntax. Then is just installed the plugin for vs code. That helped a lot. It also mainly uses rem which i never used. Further i really like using it. Feels new.
