# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Some new insights on the teleport feature of vue3. created a small component to test its functionality fast. Some small optimizations of visual studio code.

**Thoughts:** The feature is really easy and user friendly. However not completely sure in what kind of situation i would need this. Also i don't really know the smart features of visual code. This seems to cost me a lot extra clicks. Which instead i could do with just some keyboard shortcuts. Have to look more to optimizing my code editor experience :)
