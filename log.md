# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Some new insights on the teleport feature of vue3. created a small component to test its functionality fast. Some small optimizations of visual studio code.

**Thoughts:** The feature is really easy and user friendly. However not completely sure in what kind of situation i would need this. Also i don't really know the smart features of visual code. This seems to cost me a lot extra clicks. Which instead i could do with just some keyboard shortcuts. Have to look more to optimizing my code editor experience :)

### Day 2: September 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Build a vue component which draws a canvas version of the dom in utrecht netherlands

**Thoughts:** Canvas is really cool to make visual design in html. I want do more with this so in the future i will look at some libraries.

### Day 3: September 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: start building a anime suggestion component. Using new ecma features arrow function,block scopes,async,rest and spread, classes, import/export i got from a blog. Its hard getting used to arrow functions and destructering objects.

**Thoughts:** There are so many usefull new ecma functions i haven't explored yet. These will definitely help me improve some work code.

### Day 4: October 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: finished the technical part of the anime suggestion. used export function for treeshaking. Also more in depth use of await and async.

**Thoughts:** Its sometime little hard to understand how different js functions work. Also can't acces the this from the vue component. possibly i had to use bind!

### Day 5: October 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started using tailwindcss to style my anime suggestion component.

**Thoughts:** Its weird that you only use utility functions. At first its a little hard cause your not familiar with the syntax. Then is just installed the plugin for vs code. That helped a lot. It also mainly uses rem which i never used. Further i really like using it. Feels new.

### Day 6: October 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Going a little further in tailwindcss. Also rewrote the anime suggestion logic in composition api.

**Thoughts:** Composition api makes structuring the page code easier. You can better organize the functions in composable js functions. it has a little of a learning curve. Isn't as easy to learn as the options api.

### Day 7: October 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Rewrote my anime suggestion component using typescript in vue3.

**Thoughts:** Typescript is a lott different than normal js. Its a little complicated with the mass different ways of written functions. How set types etc.

### Day 8: October 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: started my portfolio website project.

**Thoughts:** Trying to get my design into tailwindcss is harder than i thought. Also trying to create an old explorer structure for design. Also started using atom design to structure my website.

### Day 9: October 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: finished the header component with styling. Started with the sidebar and teh menu. Used flexbox to order the components.

**Thoughts:** The flexbox works a little different in combination with tailwindcss. I am started to better grasp the utilities i can use.

### Day 10: October 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Build a small composable function to emit a selected event. I use it over multiple components

**Thoughts:** Not really sure if this is the best solution. I still have troubles with the event structure of vuejs. But i need to understand more to build better apps.

### Day 11: October 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Almost none, wanted to build a modal and use transition. But got stuck only creating the modals and not fully grasping the inner workings.

**Thoughts:** It was a shitty day

### Day 12: October 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: built a transition component for a folder open animation.

**Thoughts:**  It takes some tweaking to get a good transition. The classes are easy to understand.
